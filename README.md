## Penjelasan Tentang Rate Monotonic Algorithm
Rate monotonic scheduling is a priority algorithm that belongs to the static priority scheduling category of Real Time Operating Systems. It is preemptive in nature. The priority is decided according to the cycle time of the processes that are involved. If the process has a small job duration, then it has the highest priority. Thus if a process with highest priority starts execution, it will preempt the other running processes. The priority of a process is inversely proportional to the period it will run for.
